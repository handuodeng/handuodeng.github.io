    <h1>Welcome to Handuo Deng's Academic Website</h1>
    <p>I am currently a PhD candidate at Bartlett School of Planning, UCL. My research focuses on who owns, produces, and transforms space, how their interconnected practices and power dynamics have shaped existing responses to pressing socio-ecological issues, and how this has posed new challenges to effective policy interventions in sustainable urban development.</p>
    <p>My PhD research project is about recent shifts in urban development politics and urban governance in China. It draws on Chengduâ€™s municipal strategy and state actions to integrate ecological initiatives into the overarching goal of urban development. It has extensively investigated the financial orchestrations, institutional reconfigurations, and market and society mobilisation efforts by the state.</p>
    <p>My past research projects have accumulated knowledge and generated insights into how political-economic arrangements in cities have transformed urban spaces and social relationships, with a core interest in the diverse, fundamental, and disruptive role of the state. They include (1) spatial implications (e.g. housing market, land use, population distribution) from the changing role of the state, (2) strategic responses to new technologies (e.g. connected-autonomous vehicles, data platforms) and pressing challenges (e.g., urban ecological degradation, climate change), and (3) emerging financial risks, environmental injustice, and social inequalities by these practices.
