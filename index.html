    <p>Welcome! I am currently a PhD candidate at Bartlett School of Planning, UCL. My research focuses on <strong>who owns, produces, and transforms space</strong>, how their interconnected practices and power dynamics have shaped existing responses to pressing socio-ecological issues, and how this has posed new challenges to effective policy interventions in sustainable urban development.</p>
    <p>My PhD research project is about recent shifts in <strong>urban development politics and urban governance</strong> in China. It draws on Chengdu’s municipal strategy and state actions to integrate ecological initiatives into the overarching goal of urban development. It has extensively investigated the financial orchestrations, institutional reconfigurations, and market and society mobilisation efforts by the state.</p>
    <p>My past research projects have accumulated knowledge and generated insights into how political-economic arrangements in cities have transformed urban spaces and social relationships, with a core inquiry into the <strong>diverse, fundamental, and disruptive role of the state</strong>. They include (1) <strong>spatial implications</strong> (e.g. housing market, land use, population distribution) from the changing role of the state, (2) <strong>strategic responses to new technologies </strong>(e.g. connected-autonomous vehicles, data platforms) and pressing challenges (e.g., urban ecological degradation, climate change), and (3) emerging <strong>financial risks, environmental injustice, and social inequalities</strong> by these practices.</p>
    <p>I have received funding as a student PI from the National Training Program of Innovation by the Ministry of Education of China and Peking University-Lincoln Institute Centre (PLC). My postgraduate research has been funded by Cambridge Trust, UCL, and CSC. Since 2022, I have been a team member of the H2020 European Research Council Project ‘Rethinking China’s Model of Urban Governance’ and UCL-PKU strategic partner funding research ‘Towards a low-carbon city: environmental governance on climate change - A dialogue between the UK and China.’ In 2019, I engaged in research activities for PEAK Urban in Oxfordshire, UK on the governance of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) and the open data generated by them. In 2022, I was nominated as a Bateman Scholar of Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge. </p>
    <p>I am a team member of the China Planning Research Group (CPRG) based at BSP, UCL. I am a visiting research assistant at Shanghai Key Laboratory of Urban Design and Urban Science, NYU Shanghai. When I was an undergraduate at Peking University, China, I was a team member of the NSFC-DFG Sino-German Centre on Urbanization and Locality and the PKU Urban Morphology Research Group and World Heritage Research Centre.  </p>
